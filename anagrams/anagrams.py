1. Understand:
    What is an anagram?
    - anagram: a word, phrase, or name formed by rearanging the letters 
    of an other, such as spar, formed from rasp

2. > we need to generate all anagram sets
    - should have the same number of each letter
    - ANAGRAMS should be equal to the original word when both are sorted
    - How do we want to handle case? (ignore case)
   > once all sets are generated, we need to find the largest set
    - utilize some sort of MAX function
